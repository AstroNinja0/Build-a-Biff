# To celebrate ARMS' 5th anniversary
Introducing Build-a-Biff, your one-stop shop for all things Biff. In it, you can change your Biff's colors and dress it up in all kinds of outfits! Maybe your Biff is a suave debonaire or a drippin' gangsta,
Included with the source code is the Biff model used to make all the beautiful outfits. Use him as you please!
It's worth noting that this is something of an early access release, there's a few hiccups and remnants of cut features in the source but I'll be doing my best to update the project in the future!
